# Overview

Each workflow, whether predefined or customized, is initiated in the same way. A **trigger** followed by the workflow name.

# How to Trigger a SmartBlock Workflow

**Trigger:** keystrokes you type to initiate the workflow defined in your SmartBlock
To initiate a SmartBlocks workflow, type the keystrokes that initiate the workflow. By default, this is `jj` (two j's). A list will popup with available SmartBlocks Actions. Keep typing the name of the workflow to filter the list, using the up and down arrow to navigate.
Press enter or click on the workflow you want to run

The trigger could be customized by going to the SmartBlocks tab in your Roam Depot Settings and editing the `Trigger` field.

For WorkBench users: SmartBlocks appear in the WorkBench drop-down (triggered by `Ctrl-;`) for convenience.
If you had a trigger defined by a `#42Setting`, that setting will take precedence over the config page.
