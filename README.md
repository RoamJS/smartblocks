# SmartBlocks
      
Create custom and programmable templates from within Roam!

## Overview

SmartBlocks makes it easy to reuse text in a dynamic way in Roam. It can be compared to other snippet/template insertion tools like TextExpander and Alfred.  However, SmartBlocks completely lives in your Roam graph and can smartly interact with your graph. All SmartBlocks workflows are defined in the graph and are performed in your graph. SmartBlocks are made of the following key components:

- **Workflows**: These are the definitions of what the SmartBlock will do, it serves as a template for the SmartBlocks actions. These can be predefined or custom workflows. 

- **Commands:** Commands are instructions that make your SmartBlock workflow do amazing and dynamic things.

- **Trigger:** The keystrokes you type so that the workflow is run. The default keystroke is `jj`.

It will soon replace the current SmartBlocks module in Roam42.
